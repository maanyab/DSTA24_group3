# Milestone 1
DSTA24 Fall Term 2024 - Group 3

## Description
This project implements sequential model on the keras' MNIST dataset to classify images of handwritten digits.


## Prerequisites

Below are the requirements for running the code
- Python
- Dependencies including but not limited to Keras, Numpy and Tensorflow. Rest of the dependencies can be found in the requirements.txt and environment.yml files. The latter file is used for the **Alternative method** mentioned in the report while the aforementioned file is for the first method metioned in the report.

## Installation
You can run the code by cloning the main branch of the repository 

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/maanyab/DSTA24_group3.git

# Navigate to the project directory where you want to clone the repository
cd your-repository

#Create and activate the virtual environment

python -m venv myvenv  #Make sure the virtual environment is running Python 3.11
source venv/bin/activate

#Install dependencies (if applicable)
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If running the code using 1st method 
    install     environnent.yml    # If running the code using alternative method

# Use this command to run the python file
python ../Code/minist_convnet.py
```
