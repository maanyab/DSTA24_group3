# Milestone 1 Report 


## Initial Setup
To begin with, I cloned the GitHub repository to my local repository by clicking the clone repository button on visual studio code. A prompt asking for the repository URL appeared, I pasted the URL found in HTTPS section. After the repository was cloned, I made two separate folder simply using the options available on the left-handside pane (i.e. I did not use shell commands). Lastly, I also changed the branch from main to branch assigned to me.
